    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Individual Tasks:\n",
    " \n",
    "**Jon:**\n",
    "- [x] Complete pipeline and make Python package -> Pipeline code should be pip installable\n",
    "- [x] Provide evidence that the pipeline works\n",
    "- [x] Complete [documentation](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/Jupyter/ClarityViz%20Tutorial.ipynb) and organize Github repository \n",
    "\n",
    "**Luke:**\n",
    "- [x] Create [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lkzhu1/ubuntu/) for pipeline with Albert once pipeline is complete \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tony:**\n",
    "- [x] Addressed Davi Bock's issue - made a [Jupyter Notebook containing a generalized Plotly plotting script](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/reveal/october5stuff/ChangingPlotlyColorByDensity.html).  Deliverable was to apply it to [Cocaine 174](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/html/graphmlhtmls/Cocaine174localeq.5000.graphml.html) using ball size of 25, to color the voxels according to component size.  For cross referencing, made a heat map coded for each 5%; shown here is the corresponding [edge to color mapping for Cocaine 174](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/seelviz/reveal/html/graphmlhtmls/Cocaine174localeq.5000.graphmlheatmap.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Albert:**\n",
    "- [x] Create [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lkzhu1/ubuntu/) for pipeline with Luke.\n",
    "- [x] Set up [package page](https://github.com/alee156/clviz) for prototype with installation instructions.  Build passes on travis-ci.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Group Task for Albert, Luke, Tony:\n",
    "Show the 40,000 brightest points in registered space relative to the registered region.  Tasks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Albert:**\n",
    "- [x] Downsample or obtain atlas and one raw image so that they are less than 2 GB in size\n",
    "    - Learned from Kwame how to downsample effectively using \"spacing\".\n",
    "- [x] Write code for aligning atlas to the raw images instead of other way around:\n",
    "    - https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/ReverseAlignmentDownsampled.ipynb\n",
    "    - https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/albert/brainalign.py\n",
    "- [x] Write code used for resolution 5 images on server\n",
    "    - https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/albert/brainalign.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Luke:\n",
    "- [x] Run code on resolution 5 images using server\n",
    "- [x] Create plotly plot representing each region of the brain as a different color\n",
    "- [x] Sum intensity in each region\n",
    "\n",
    "Tony:\n",
    "- [x] Create plotly plot of graphml network on\n",
    "    - Made a [Jupyter Notebook containing a generalized Plotly plotting script that plots using our preset configurations](https://github.com/NeuroDataDesign/seelviz/blob/gh-pages/Jupyter/PlotlyGraphMLOnly.ipynb).\n",
    "    - [New brain (100k)]()\n",
    "    - [Old brain (Control258) (40k nodes)]()\n",
    "- [x] Setup useable server and install all packages\n",
    "    - Used GoogleCloud free trial ($300 credit) and made the equivalent of an Amazon EC2 instance.\n",
