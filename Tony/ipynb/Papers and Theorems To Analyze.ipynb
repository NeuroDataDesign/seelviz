    "        - Approach written in MATLAB, for use in cell segmentation\n",
    "        - Uses CLAHE to threshold, then uses unique membrane dynamics to examine cell boundaries.\n",

    "        - Approach:\n",
    "            - Substack entire thing into WxHxD pieces\n",
    "            - Make sure substacks overlap (some dimension M) such as to prevent borders from improperly being trained (make sure all cells fall within WxHxD?  need more reading)\n",
    "            - Two inputs: L, S (each point intensity represented as (x, y, z))\n",
    "                - L - set of voxels whose intensities exceed background intensity\n",
    "                - S - specially selected subset to run mean-shift algorithm\n",
    "            - Mean shift algorithm\n",
    "                - The classic mean shift algorithm would start from all available data points, place a kernel on each of them and shift each point toward the mean value computed as the kernel-weighted average of the data.\n",
    "                - In this variant, they improve both its running time and its statistical precision by starting from a carefully chosen set of seeds S\n",
    "            - Thresholding\n",
    "                - Found background/saturated areas and removed as basic filters.\n",
    "            - Supervised semantic deconvolution\n",
    "                - Above step works well on bright images.  Darker somas might be missed.\n",
    "                - To improve over this intrinsic difficulty, they carried out a preprocessing stage by applying a non-linear filter trained to boost weak somata and decrease the voxel intensities in non-soma regions.\n",

    "    Gradient Flow:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4578315/\n",
    "        - Approach is to find \"gradient\" of background (ie - derivatives w.r.t X, Y, Z) and set them to zero\n",
