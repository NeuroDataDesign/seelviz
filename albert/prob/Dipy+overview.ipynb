    "dMRI is special in its application of pulsed magnetic gradients to make diffusion sensitive measurements. The specific sensitivity is based on the b value, a set of parameters including duration of gradient, time between gradient pulses, and gradient amplitude. The specific directionality of the magnetif field gradient is shown by unit vectors called b vectors.\n",

    "For simplicity's sake we will call tractography the computational art of detecting and delineating fibers. In dMRI this is done by generating \"streamlines\" - imaginary lines that run along the most likely directions of diffusion shown by the b values and vectors."

    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Background Removal\n",
    "A median filter is used to smooth the volume and then an Otsu filter is used the separate the brain from the background. Ultimately this separates the volumes into two, one for the foreground and one for the background.\n",

There is no naturally included magnetic gradient information (because there is none) and most importantly the b values and vectors are thus not applicable quantities. This obviously makes tractography difficult because of the dependence on both probabilistic and deterministic algorithms on the gradient table calculated from the b values and vectors."

A seed point is genereated and is used along a propagation direction that is randomly chosen from fODF, and then is continuously adjusted based on sampleing of the fODF at each new location. This only terminates when the pre-programmed stopping criteria is met. \n",
